## Data Set : https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set
Project Aim : Develop models to classify licit and illicit transactions in bitcoin network
Why is it interesting
As per the associated paperâ€™s background, being able to identify licit and illicit transactions will
enable more robust regulation of the use of the bitcoin network and possibly other digital
currency networks. This will help to boost confidence in the legitimacy of these currencies and
also improve equitable access to these financial services.
Additionally, the use of graphical data is a relatively untapped area in machine learning.
Learning how to represent graphical data in more traditional forms and also how new network
structures like Graph Convolutional Networks function will be very educational in its own right.
Furthermore, the set of unlabeled data provides the opportunity to learn about semi-supervised
learning as well.
Challenges
The dataset is imbalanced (10% Illicit cases vs. licit) and still around 75% of data are unlabeled.
Some of the features in the dataset are anonymised, which will make it harder to understand the
data. Additionally, GCNs and other network structures for graphical data are probably newer and
less accessible in terms of understanding and package implementations than other models.
Types of models
Logistic regression
SVM
Random forest
GCNs and other graphical neural networks
